# vanilla-react

This is a simple ToDo list made in React with the minimum boilerplate needed. This project is intended to understand React and JSX without the big boilerplate created by the CLI.

## Prerequisites

Except from serve, all dependencies are included in the project. We need serve the static files from a web server so that we can use Babel without a transpiler.

```bash
$ npm install serve -g
```

## Run

```bash
$ serve
```
